# Spotify-Data-Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, we used data from Spotify to establish multiple models through regression
analysis, classification analysis and clustering methods to find the relationship between
features and certain characteristics.
In the prediction part, we established OLS, WLS, KNN, decision tree models as regression
approaches; Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic regression as classification approaches. We
will explore which method is the most accurate and have the best performance for our
analysis.
In the clustering part, we established PCA and K-means cluster methods to group the songs
by genres. And we will find out which genre would be the most influential to the popularity
of a song.
## Project Objective
This report has two main objectives. On one hand, it aims to predict popularity rating by
regression and classification models, and select the best model for prediction. On the other
hand, it aims to differentiate genres by clustering.
